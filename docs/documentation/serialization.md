# Serialization

Since this addon is written in the Rust language, it is fairly easy to save and load the state of it at any time, via the StateManager node (see [StateManager Node](/state-manager-node.md)).

## Space

All the physics objects are grouped inside **spaces** (eg. a space contains all objects). Even if you don't create a space, a default space exists and can be obtained from:

```js
var space_2d_rid = get_viewport().world_2d.space
# or
var space_3d_rid = get_viewport().world_3d.space
```


:::note SubViewports

If you want the physics simulation to happen inside another space and not interact with the default space, you can create a new space by creating a new [SubViewport](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/rendering/viewports.html). These come with new **world_2d** and/or **world_3d** instances. If you do this, you also have to render the new viewport using [SubViewportContainer](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_subviewportcontainer.html#class-subviewportcontainer).
