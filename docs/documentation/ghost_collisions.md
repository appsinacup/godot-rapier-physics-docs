# Ghost Collisions

Ghost Collisions are collisions that stop objects from moving when intersecting with a static object made out of multiple pieces of geometry (tile sets, polygon).

There are 2 things implemented to fix ghost collisions.

1. The first implementation follows the idea of [Brian Semrau - Dealing with Ghost Collisions](https://briansemrau.github.io/dealing-with-ghost-collisions/) article. For a more in-depth explanation read his article.

2. The second one fixes the normals of polygons that have information about points nearby, follows an idea similar to this [box2D Ghost Collisions](https://box2d.org/posts/2020/06/ghost-collisions/) (right now it's implemented just for 3D though).

## Ghost Collisions Fix in modify_contacts

The first fix is to disable the contacts in the [PhysicsHooks::modify_solver_contacts](https://rapier.rs/docs/user_guides/rust/advanced_collision_detection/#contact-modification) event if:

1. The contact normal opposes the playerâ€™s velocity (which could cause the player to get caught).
2. The contact distance is smaller than the `physics/rapier/logic/ghost_collision_distance` project setting value. (Note, here we are also taking the velocity in consideration)

In order to activate it set `physics/rapier/logic/ghost_collision_distance` to `1.0` or something bigger.

## Side Effects

The side effects of this solution is that objects might pass through each other a bit. If this is not intended you can disable it by setting the `ghost_collision_distance` to 0.
